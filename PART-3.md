# Performant Web Apps (due July 3rd)

## 1. HTTP's Request/Response Cycle
You'll learn the ins and outs of requests. You'll look at how a page is requested, the headers that are received, HTTP codes, and how data is transferred.

## 2. HTTP/1
You'll take a deep dive into HTTP verbs. You'll dig in deep to the vital headers used in HTTP. You'll also learn how to efficiently structure applications using REST.

## 3. HTTPS
You'll discover just how important security is to the web. You'll learn about TLS, discover issues with loading mixed content, have a quick primer on cryptography and verify Certificate Authorities.

## 4. HTTP/2
HTTP/1 is great, but the future is HTTP/2! You'll learn about the changes that HTTP/2 brings. You'll learn the current "best practices" that HTTP/1 extols, but that are now anti-patterns in HTTP/2.

## 5. Security
Security is vital for every web application! You'll learn about common security pitfalls and how to avoid them. You'll also get a chance to don your white hat and hack into a (sample) bank's website.

## 6. Requests & Responses
In this lesson, you will examine HTTP requests and responses by experimenting directly with a web server, interacting with it by hand.

## 7. The Web from Python
In this lesson, you will write HTTP servers and clients in Python.

## 8. HTTP in the Real World
In this lesson, you will examine a number of practical HTTP features that go beyond basic requests and responses.

## 9. The Critical Rendering Path
Follow along with Paul Lewis and Cameron Pittman as they explain common performance issues on the web and what we should be hoping to achieve in terms of speed.

## 10. App Lifecycles
Learn about the four parts of a web app's lifecycle: RAIL (Response, Animate, Idle, and Load). You'll discover how these phases cause jank in your web apps.

## 11. Weapons of Jank Destruction
Learn how to use Chrome's Developer Tools Timeline to find page jank and remove it from your site.

## 12. JavaScript
Learn how to use JavaScript to optimize animations and use web workers to speed up performance.

## 13. Styles and Layout
Discover how changing styles can result in surprisingly slow page speed. You'll also learn how to prevent Forced Synchronous Layouts.

## 14. Compositing and Painting
Learn how to manage page layers and improve page performance using the Chrome Dev Tools Paint Profiler.

## PROJECT - Restaurant Reviews App — Stage 3
Given a backend server, implement login and review submission logic on the client side, add search capability to the database and leverage offline capabilities.
